### Badtz UI is Now Fully Open Source  

After months of work and countless improvements, we are excited to announce that Badtz UI is now completely open source. This marks a new phase for the project, allowing developers worldwide to contribute, customize, and integrate our UI components freely into their projects.

Beyond this major milestone, we have introduced a complete visual rework of the library, ensuring a more polished, modern, and consistent experience.

### A Full Visual Rework  

Badtz UI has undergone a complete redesign to enhance aesthetics, usability, and overall coherence.  
Here’s what’s new:  

- A redesigned interface with a more refined and modern look  
- Improved component structure for better usability  
- Optimized dark and light modes for seamless adaptability  

The interface is now cleaner and more intuitive, making it easier than ever to build high-quality user interfaces.

### Major Component Upgrades  

Alongside the visual revamp, we have reworked most of our components to improve performance and usability. Key improvements include:  

- Optimized shader components for better rendering and efficiency  
- Automatic resizing to adapt dynamically to different screen sizes  
- Aspect ratio enforcement to ensure proper scaling  
- Automatic disabling of shader-heavy effects on mobile devices to enhance performance  

These refinements ensure that every component delivers a smooth experience across all screen sizes and devices.

### What's Next?  

The journey does not stop here. In one month, we will be launching Badtz UI Pro, unlocking additional advanced features.  

Starting next month, we will begin releasing one new component per day for our growing library.  
Our goal is to establish Badtz UI as a comprehensive and reliable UI solution for developers.
