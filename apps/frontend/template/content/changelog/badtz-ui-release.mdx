### Badtz UI is Officially Released

Today marks the official launch of **Badtz UI**, our open-source component library built for high-performing landing pages. After months of iteration, polishing, and feedback, the library is ready for real-world usage and open to all developers.

Every component in Badtz UI is crafted with care: optimized for Tailwind CSS, focused on conversion, and easy to customize for any landing experience.

This is just the beginning.



### Starting Now: One Component Per Day

To accelerate growth and improve the library at a steady pace, we’re launching a **daily release cycle**: from today on, we’ll publish **one new component every single day**.

These components are designed specifically for landing pages. They are lightweight, clean, and designed for maximum reusability across any project using Tailwind and React.



### 5 New Components Weekly in the Open-Source Library

Out of these daily releases, **5 components per week** will be included in the official open-source package of **Badtz UI**.

This ensures the library continues to grow consistently while remaining stable, curated, and easy to follow.

All components will be:

- Production-ready
- Mobile-responsive
- Built with accessibility in mind
- Consistently styled and documented

If you’re building marketing pages, startup sites, SaaS landers, or portfolio pages — this library is for you.



### 2 New Sections or Templates Weekly for Badtz UI Pro

For users on the **Pro plan**, we’re introducing an additional track focused on speed and structure:

- **2 complete blocks or full landing page templates** will be released every week
- Built from existing components and enhanced with layout logic, content patterns, and visual hierarchy
- Ready to drop into any marketing page and fully responsive out of the box

These templates are ideal for freelancers, teams, and makers who need to ship fast without reinventing layout structure.



### Tailwind CSS v4 Migration Next Week

As Tailwind CSS continues to evolve, we’re staying up to date.  
We’re planning to **migrate Badtz UI to Tailwind CSS v4 starting early next week**.

This migration will bring:

- Smaller output thanks to new tree-shaking logic
- Improved developer experience with updated config syntax
- Better performance across builds and runtimes

We’ll handle the transition smoothly and keep all components compatible throughout the update.



### What’s Next

Now that the official release is behind us, our focus turns to expanding and improving the ecosystem around Badtz UI. Here’s what we’re working on:

- Improved documentation and interactive playgrounds
- Live theming support and design token system
- Integration examples for Next.js, Astro, and Vite
- Accessibility and performance enhancements
- A visual editor (experimental) for building with components and blocks

We’re not just releasing a library — we’re building a rhythm, a system, and a toolset that evolves with you.



### Thank You

We’re grateful to everyone who supported Badtz UI during its early development, shared feedback, starred the GitHub repo, and helped shape its direction.

This official release opens a new chapter — and it starts today, with a new component every single day.

Keep building. We’ll keep shipping.
