### A Journey Just Beginning

This pre-release marks the initial stage of Badtz UI. While we are thrilled to share it with you, we acknowledge that there are still aspects that need polishing. We invite our early users to explore the library, experiment with its features, and provide valuable feedback. If you come across any bugs or inconsistencies, please do not hesitate to report them. Your feedback will be instrumental in helping us enhance the overall experience.

### What’s Next?

Over the upcoming weeks, our primary focus will be on identifying and fixing potential bugs to ensure the library's stability. We will also be rolling out additional components marked with the “(soon)” tag as we fine-tune them. This systematic approach will allow us to complete the foundation of Badtz UI and set the stage for a comprehensive, full-feature release.

### Our Commitment

Once the initial bug fixes and component releases are complete, we will continue expanding the library by adding new, innovative components to meet the diverse needs of developers. Our goal is to reach a full release that is robust and reliable, creating a UI library that developers can trust and leverage in their projects.

If you’re using Badtz UI, we’d love to hear from you. Your experiences and insights are invaluable as we shape Badtz UI into a tool that serves the community effectively.

Thank you for being part of this journey, and welcome to the first chapter of Badtz UI!
